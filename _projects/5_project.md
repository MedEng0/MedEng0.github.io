### Caution!
The [HPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) is a rapidly changing field. I only update the materials in every iteration I do and Therefore it is best to consult multiple sources.
### A Taste of Linux
The world of [High-performance computing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High-performance_computing) is dominated by [Supercomputers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercomputer) that 
have a [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) [OS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_system) therefore a bit of [Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux) is kind of a [De facto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_facto) standard.  
I suggest the following sources to a get a hang of things:  
[Linux Essentials](file:///Users/rknot/Downloads/LPI-Learning-Material-010-160-en.pdf)  
[Introduction to Linux in HPC NRW](https://hpc-wiki.info/hpc/Introduction_to_Linux_in_HPC)
